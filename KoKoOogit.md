# Pixel Box

## Summary

While I was listening to Spotify, I suddenly got an idea to build a Pixel Box- Smart Digital Picture Frame that dispaly picture as Pixel using matrix display.
## Plan

Firstly, I will try out some tutorials on the internet. After I learned, how to use all the tools, I will start to create Pixel Box. I will use https://www.instructables.com/Raspberry-PI-Pixel-Art-Animation-Display/ for the project guideline.

## Budget

I don't have a 3D printer.So, I will skip all the 3d printing steps and I will do only the electronics part.

These charges doesn't include the shipping and tax. If the total is over $250, I will buy the rest by myself. In order to connect Pi Zero 2 to attach with the Matrix bonnet, we have to use the 20 pin GPIO header to plug in to the Pi Zero 2. As most of the answers in this [Stackexchange](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/139513/do-we-have-to-solder-headers-to-gpio-pins) recommends to solder these GPIO pins to the Pi Zero 2, I included soldering kit in the list. Instead of using 3d printed parts, I will use a rectangle light box frame and I will buy it by myself. I also saw that the frame can be created with cardboards.
